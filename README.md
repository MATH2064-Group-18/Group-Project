# Group Project -- Group 18

Welcome! For our MATH2064 project, we have chosen **Real-Time Fluid Simulation**. To make it easier to use, we have turned the core of this project into its own Julia package [Swirl.jl](https://github.com/MATH2064-Group-18/Swirl.jl), which can be added to any project using:
```julia
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/MATH2064-Group-18/Swirl.jl")
```

In this repo you will find some demos using it.


## Setup

run `setup.jl` using
```bash
julia setup.jl
```
Finished! Now you are ready to run the included demos. Inside each folder, the README contains instructions for how to run.
